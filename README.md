- Setting the Goal Score: At the beginning of the game, both players agree on a target score that they need to reach to win the game.

- Player 1's Turn: Player 1 starts the game by rolling the two dice together. The numbers rolled on both dice are added up, and the total is added to Player 1's current score.

- Player 2's Turn: After Player 1's turn, it's now Player 2's turn. Player 2 rolls the two dice together, and the total sum of the dice is added to Player 2's current score.

- Winning Condition: The game continues with both players taking turns rolling the dice and adding the scores to their current total. The first player to reach the final score wins the game. Once a player reaches the Final Score, the game ends immediately, and that player is declared the winner.

This simple dice game requires luck and strategy, as players aim to reach the final score before their opponent does. Enjoy playing the game and may the best roller win!
